# Preface:

So, this is my first time attempting to mod stuff, and it might take a while to refine everything, but I'm hoping that by the end of this endeavour I'll have a decent compilation of mods others can use to enhance their game experience. This suite is intended to implement a couple QoL changes, at least until the main game adds it themselves.

# List of mods included in the suite:
- EasyStack: Adds number box to stack-splitting menu.
